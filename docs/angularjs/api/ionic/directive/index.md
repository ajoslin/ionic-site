        <td><p>While Ionic provides simple Header and Footer bars that can be created through
HTML and CSS alone, Header bars specifically can be extended in order to
provide dynamic layout features such as auto-title centering and animation.
They are also used by the Views and Navigation Controller to animate a title
on navigation and toggle a back button.
*
The main header bar feature provide is auto title centering.
In this situation, the title text will center itself until either the
left or right button content is too wide for the label to center.
In that case, it will slide left or right until it can fit.
You can also align the title left for a more Android-friendly header.</p>
